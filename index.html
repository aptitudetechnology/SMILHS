                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>SMILHS is dedicated to creating **Minimum Viable Prototypes (MVPs)** of living systems within a simulated environment. By digitally conceptualizing simplified organisms, we aim to model genetic changes and observe their potential downstream effects on cellular processes. Our goal is to develop an accessible platform for generating hypotheses about biological interactions and potential research avenues.</p>
                <p>Our initial MVP explorations may focus on: <em>Simulating basic genetic scenarios in a minimal, synthetic organism to observe their simulated impact on fundamental cellular processes.</em></p>
