                <h3>About Our Mission</h3>
                <p>SMILHS focuses on creating **Minimum Viable Prototypes (MVPs)** of living systems within a simulated environment. By digitally engineering simplified organisms, we can precisely model genetic mutations and observe their downstream effects on cellular health and function. Our goal is to provide a rapid, cost-effective, and ethically sound platform for generating hypotheses about disease progression and potential interventions.</p>
                <p>Our initial MVP will focus on: <em>Simulating a basic genetic defect in a minimal, synthetic organism and observing its simulated impact on a fundamental cellular process.</em></p>
